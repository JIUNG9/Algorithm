### Approach 
1. The point is using the binary operator. Find the person which is qualified by using binary operator
2. python and c# developer can find easily which use the like operator at where clause otherwise. Finding FrontEnd devloper should use the sum aggregate function. so group by the category and use the where clause for getting only frontend developer
3. with window function can handle this problem. but the rest of the developers which isn't classified even 'C' should filter. by using having clause can be filtered.
