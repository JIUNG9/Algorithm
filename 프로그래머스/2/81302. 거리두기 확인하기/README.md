### Approach
- If can go one step the position which will be moved is not 'X' go. If the position already moved character is not 'P' moved one more step
- But do not go back the original position. so If go to right, and then do not go left after then. so when there is 'P' with one step or further step add the 0 at answer or add the answer 1.
