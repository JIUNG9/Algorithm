### Approach
- Impl: The input size is 10,000 so dfs is not appropriate with this problem, So use the two pointer(should search for all elemnts but n^2 is not tolerable), Use the two pointer convention and add the condition when left pointer is reached to the input size it will be considered the last case of this problem
