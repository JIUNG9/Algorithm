### Approach
- Approach with the DFS is more efficient there is the case which can't reach to the end when routing with alphabetical asc order.
- DFS approach: start from the ICN when reaching the end of the ticket length  add the answerList or compare the already exist order.
- at the end of the dfs get the first element of the List element or return the answer(cuz already compared)
